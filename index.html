                <span class="card-title">ABSOLUTELY, ANNOUNCING LOVE KNOCKS TWICE IN BURLINGTON IA!</span>
            </div>
            <p>We are excited to announce the dates that you are able to watch our first short film. We first wanted to
                announce SHOCK PARTY HORROR MOVIE MARATHON in Burlington, Iowa. If you are a horror fan in the area, we
                would highly recommend that you come out for a night of vintage horror. BUT ALSO I would recommend that
                you
                keep an eye out for their calendar in general. In April, they had a great night of Italian horror,
                SNAFFTER
                Dark brought in a lot of horror short films in July, and the month of October has an absolutely STACKED
                lineup of absolute classics. The Capitol is absolutely worth coming out to.</p>

            <p>Burlington’s classic Snake Alley landmark is absolutely nuts and we personally cannot believe YOU can
                just
                drive on it. Like there’s absolutely no barrier or tickets, it's a whole road of anxiety as a fun quirk
                of
                the town.</p>

            <p>Come see LOVE KNOCKS TWICE, and stay tuned for Horrors of the Black Mueseum, Burn Witch Burn, and The Pit
                and the Pendulum. We hear there’s free coffee and donuts for those who make it long and thank you to
                Tadd
                for being so great in programming it!</p>

            </div>
            <p>Joc and Lew use the party game Pitchstorm to draw two random cards and try to come up with an idea for a
                movie on the spot. The upcoming Soccer Mafia blockbuster is going well until it’s time to draw a
                “Producer Note” card and things get derailed into a snow bank. We also talk about if it’s okay to make
                jokes about the Quad Cities after living here for almost 3 years. </p>
