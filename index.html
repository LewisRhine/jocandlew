            </div>
            <p>We want to talk about and announce a screening of LOVE KNOCKS TWICE that is pretty special to us. Rozz
                Tox will be
                hosting us in the 12 Hours of Terror programming, and it is our first creative output that will be shown
                at a place that
                is a staple of creating a space for artistry locally and worldwide. We put this announcement later
                because they update
                mostly only on their website which we love anything that doesn’t give more attention to the meta
                machine.</p>

            <p>We first visited Rozz Tox on a Friday the 13th screening… in March of 2020 and it has infected us since.
                It is such a
                special curated unique place. It is a venue that we are honored to be alongside that regularly hosts
                movie and
                philosophy discussions, all sorts of different musical acts from around the world, art shows, amateur
                vinyl dj sets,
                garden movies, goofy game shows, a go club, and more! It is a gem to the quad cities, and we are
                grateful they are
                extending their stage to a couple of normie knuckleheads.</p>

            <p>We still need to coordinate but we plan to make this one *extra special*, we will bring some things to
                giveaway, Lab
                puppet will be there, and probably more! This is also the only showing IN PERSON that is FREE AND OPEN!
                Please come!!
                October 25th, Rozz Tox in Rock Island, IL. BE THERE AT 6 so you aren’t late when it plays at 6:15pm
                lol.</p>

                <span class="card-title">ABSOLUTELY, ANNOUNCING LOVE KNOCKS TWICE IN BURLINGTON IA!</span>
            </div>
            <p>We are excited to announce the dates that you are able to watch our first short film. We first wanted to
                announce SHOCK PARTY HORROR MOVIE MARATHON in Burlington, Iowa. If you are a horror fan in the area, we
                would highly recommend that you come out for a night of vintage horror. BUT ALSO I would recommend that
                you
                keep an eye out for their calendar in general. In April, they had a great night of Italian horror,
                SNAFFTER
                Dark brought in a lot of horror short films in July, and the month of October has an absolutely STACKED
                lineup of absolute classics. The Capitol is absolutely worth coming out to.</p>

            <p>Burlington’s classic Snake Alley landmark is absolutely nuts and we personally cannot believe YOU can
                just
                drive on it. Like there’s absolutely no barrier or tickets, it's a whole road of anxiety as a fun quirk
                of
                the town.</p>

            <p>Come see LOVE KNOCKS TWICE, and stay tuned for Horrors of the Black Mueseum, Burn Witch Burn, and The Pit
                and the Pendulum. We hear there’s free coffee and donuts for those who make it long and thank you to
                Tadd
                for being so great in programming it!</p>

            <p>Joc and Lew use the party game Pitchstorm to draw two random cards and try to come up with an idea for a
                movie on the spot. The upcoming Soccer Mafia blockbuster is going well until it’s time to draw a
                “Producer Note” card and things get derailed into a snow bank. We also talk about if it’s okay to make
                jokes about the Quad Cities after living here for almost 3 years. </p>
