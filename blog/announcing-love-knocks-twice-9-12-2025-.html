        <h1>Hey! We are Jocelyn and Lewis.</h1>
        <p>Hi Website Visitors!</p>
        <p>We are so proud to announce our first short film, Love Knocks Twice, is done and will soon be on a screen
            near
            you!*
        </p>
        <p>*If you are currently located in the Quad Cities.</p>
        <p>We will have announcements of screenings coming soon.</p>
        <p>
            We have talked about and have wanted to pursue film for a long time. After making this, we wish we started
            sooner, but in a lot of ways we are really happy for this being our first big project. If you know us
            intimately, you would know that we really had to build a life for ourselves to sustain a big project like
            this.
            This project has come together through building a financial base for ourselves, finding a community but also
            a
            journey of coming back to ourselves and a goal we have wanted to pursue since before we had even gotten
            together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every year was a year for some time now where we said “This is going to be the year we do this.” And this
            year
            we can officially say that we did.
        </p>
        <p>
            We met great and talented creatives, put ourselves out there in ways we hadn’t in years, and really laser
            focused on this. And although we did focus on this, this project is built up from years of practice that we
            no
            longer have published, were on stages that don’t exist anymore, and from a lifelong habit of riffing with
            each
            other.
        </p>
        <p>
            We don’t mean to become saccharine, but in a lot of ways, the things that this project has given us that is
            not
            seen has in a lot of ways become quite bigger than the movie itself. Which to be honest- it’s a silly horror
            movie with a dog puppet, shot on an entry DSLR, with a slim team…
        </p>
        <p>
            We are grateful to <a href="https://www.justinbeahm.com/" target="_blank">Justin Beahm</a> for freely and
            accessibly sharing his career experiences,
            sometimes you do
            need
            that one motivational talk to try again.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are grateful to Jason Whitmarsh for sharing his acting talent, his drive to help as hands on the second
            shoot
            and collection of weird shit that helped fill out the Kooky Kenny set.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are grateful to Devin and C.M. Alexander and <a href="https://giallows.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Giallows</a>
            for writing such an amazing score and for Devin’s
            goofy
            ass faces during the movie, also for sharing their perspectives and experiences in filmmaking. Devin stepped
            up
            in a big way to star in the movie, and landed the performance with great comedic timing.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are grateful to Justin Marxen, for his conversations about movies and his enthusiasm for the film…until
            he
            got hit by a car. He’s fine! We have really come to enjoy talking about movies with him and his love of
            action
            movies is palpable. His enthusiasm and willingness to work with us made us excited that we could make movies
            here.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are grateful to The Underwood’s, their generosity and friendship is special to us. We cannot believe
            Jason
            stayed up that late with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are grateful to Justice Symone, who came out to ostensibly a stranger’s house to be in an ostensibly a
            stranger’s movie when we rewrote after the new casting.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are grateful for the folks at Rozz Tox for being so quick to play our movie and to be there to talk about
            it during the process of it.
        </p>
        <p>See LOVE KNOCKS TWICE soon.</p>
